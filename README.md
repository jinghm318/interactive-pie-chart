On this demo I added remove and lock feature to Raphael.js interactive pie chart.
Raphael Js web sample:  http://raphaeljs.com/growing-pie.html

A Sample project on Heruko: http://atlasmap.herokuapp.com/pie/growing-pie.html

The problem with that sample was that there was never given a chance to the user to remove one category or lock the value of a specific
pie piece. 

This is a demo and the code is not a production ready code. 
Unfortunately I found that my solution is not intuitive and has some cognitive overload. 
I am trying to find a better approach.
